# * Notes to Sega:
#                                
#   The format of this file is such that the left-hand word
#   does *not* get translated - it is a 'tag' used internally in
#   the game.  After the tag there are tab characters, and then
#   the translation text, which must be on the same line - don't
#   press RETURN until all of the text for that tag has been
#   entered.
# *
#   Comments are introduced by the '#' character as the first
#   character on a line, followed by at least one space, then
#   the rest of the line is ignored.  Comments *do not* need
#   translation.
# *
#   Throughout this file, if more than one translation needs
#   to be used at once in the game, or if a user-supplied
#   parameter, such as a profile name, needs to be inserted,
#   some special combinations of characters are used.
#   All these special characters begin with a percent sign.
#   Most of the tags using this system should be commented so
#   you know which text is going where.  For example:
#   TIME				Time: %d:%02d
#   will come out in the game as something like 'Time: 1:30'
# *
#   Text colour changes within a translation are handled with
#   some other magic characters, all starting and ending with 
#   a tilde character (~) - for example:
#   MP_DM_PLURAL			~cff0000~%d~x~ kills required to win
#   Will come out as something like '5 kills required to win'
#   except that the '5' will be in bright red
# *
#   Anything inside square brackets ([, ]) is a language change
#   statement - just ignore it if I've inadvertantly left any
#   in.  
# *
#   Hope this helps

# Volcano
VOL_LOCATION			VOLCANIC ISLAND OUTPOST
VOL_TIME				13:51 hours
VOL_OBJECTIVE			SEARCH AND DESTROY GENERATOR
VOL_BRIEFING			The Haak forces are in the early stages of setting up a base on this volcanic isle. Our intelligence operatives tell us that the Haak mobile generator unit, which provides all power to the base, has just been installed deep in the volcano core and it will not be long after this before the base becomes fully operational. If we let this happen it will strike a serious strategic blow against the allied forces. Your mission is to get to this mobile generator unit and destroy it.

# Canyon
CAN_LOCATION			GRAND CANYON DOCKS ZONE
CAN_TIME			11:35 hours
CAN_OBJECTIVE			CHEMICAL WEAPONS DROID ESCORT
CAN_BRIEFING			This remote trading post was the first to fall to the Haak, now we want it back.  An explosive device containing a chemical poison has been constructed at our military post close to the trade village.  We want you to escort the payload to the alien hive at the far end of the docks.  The droid hull is fragile so don't let anything come between the tanker and its destination.
CAN_SCRIPT1				You'd better get out of there Commander, the droid is now activated and about to blow.  Get back outside for pick-up from the blast zone.
CAN_SCRIPT2				INCOMING !!!  Haak battleship closing in fast from behind!!!

# Ice
ICE_LOCATION			ARCTIC RESEARCH CENTRE
ICE_TIME			08:20 hours
ICE_OBJECTIVE			ELIMINATE CRUISE LASER THREAT
ICE_BRIEFING			We had been working with the Haak on an offensive laser at our Arctic Research Centre. The "Cruise Laser" has unsurpassed range and devastating destructive power.  However, all human members of the research team have been expelled from the centre and the Haak have realigned the Cruise Laser Battery and are now targeting three of our strategic sites. Get in there Commander and destroy each of the Cruise Lasers before the Haak decide to activate them, wiping out thousands.

# Hydro
HYD_LOCATION			UNDERGROUND HYDRO GENERATOR
HYD_TIME			20:08 hours
HYD_OBJECTIVE			SEARCH AND DESTROY PROTOTYPE SUBMARINE
HYD_BRIEFING			The Haak have underestimated the power of our water-based forces and we have scored significant victories in this area in the past few weeks. All this could change however if we do not act quickly. Our intelligence operatives tell us that the Haak have taken control of a underground dam complex and are draining massive amounts of power to charge up some kind of prototype amphibious super weapon. We have found an emergency overflow entrance to the dam. Your mission is to infiltrate this underground base and destroy this super weapon before it becomes operational.

# City
CIT_LOCATION			RED DOG RESEARCH CITY
CIT_TIME			05:08 hours
CIT_OBJECTIVE			DESTROY FORCES ATTACKING CENTRAL RESEARCH CENTRE
CIT_BRIEFING			The Haak forces have launched a full scale offensive on our largest weapons research facility. Fortunately most of the population were able to evacuate before the attack arrived. However a select few stayed behind to collate their findings before they were lost forever - now its time to get them out. Your mission is to get to the main research building housing the remaining scientists and destroy the surrounding Haak units so the scientists can escape.

CIT_LOCATION2			RED DOG RESEARCH CITY
CIT_TIME2			05:11 hours
CIT_OBJECTIVE2			ESCORT SCIENTISTS TO SAFE ZONE
CIT_BRIEFING2			Escort the armoured vehicle to a safe bunker along the path lined by the green flares. Destroy any alien resistance that gets in your way.

CIT_LOCATION3			RED DOG RESEARCH CITY
CIT_TIME3			05:15 hours
CIT_OBJECTIVE3			PROTECT BUNKER UNTIL DROPSHIP ARRIVES
CIT_BRIEFING3			The dropship will be with you in approximately two minutes. You must protect the bunker at all costs until the dropship arrives. The Haak know the significance of our scientists and have mobilised a number of heavy duty units to destroy the bunker. These units are highly armoured and almost invulnerable to your weapon fire. They have only one weak spot: a small area on the rear of the vehicle which, if hit, will cause a chain reaction destroying the whole unit.

# Alien
ALI_LOCATION			THE HAAK MOTHERSHIP
ALI_TIME				01:00 hours
ALI_OBJECTIVE			DESTROY THE CENTRAL GENERATOR CORE
ALI_BRIEFING			Weakened by the significant victories we have had on Earth, the Haak are regrouping on their mothership for one final push. However, our victories have been at a heavy cost to the Red Dog forces. If they attack en masse now we would not stand a chance. Therefore we must take the fight to them. We're gonna throw everything we've got at them to cause a diversion that will hopefully allow us to drop you off on the outside of the mothership. From there you must proceed to the central reactor core and blow the place from the inside. This is Earth's last chance. Good luck.

# Volcano
VOL_LOCATION			KRAKATAU, DETROIT DE SUNDA
VOL_TIME				13:51
VOL_OBJECTIVE			Trouver et détruire le générateur
VOL_BRIEFING			L'armée Haak commence à construire une base sur cette île volcanique. Nos agents secrets nous informent qu'ils viennent d'installer un générateur mobile qui fournit toute l'électricité pour la base. Il se trouve au cœur du volcan, et dans très peu de temps la base sera pleinement opérationnelle. Si cette base fonctionnait à plein, ce serait un coup terrible pour les armées alliées. Votre mission est de trouver ce générateur mobile et de le détruire.

# Canyon
CAN_LOCATION			Village de commerce du Grand Canyon
CAN_TIME			11:35
CAN_OBJECTIVE			Escorter le camion-citerne droïde
CAN_BRIEFING			Ce centre commercial isolé était le premier à tomber sous la domination Haak : nous voulons le récupérer. Notre base militaire de la région a fabriqué un engin explosif contenant un poison chimique. Vous devez escorter la charge explosive jusqu'à la base Haak à l'autre bout des docks. La coque du droïde est assez fragile alors protégez bien le camion-citerne jusqu'à sa destination.
CAN_SCRIPT1				Sortez de là Commandant ! Le droïde est activé et il est sur le point d'exploser. Sortez de là pour qu'on puisse vous récupérer.
CAN_SCRIPT2				ATTENTION !!! Un vaisseau de combat Haak arrive derrière nous, et à toute vitesse !

# Ice
ICE_LOCATION			L'Antarctique
ICE_TIME			08:20
ICE_OBJECTIVE			Éliminer la menace du laser de croisière
ICE_BRIEFING			Nous avons travaillé avec les Haak sur un laser à notre Centre de Recherche de l'Antarctique. Ce 'laser de croisière' a une portée supérieure aux autres armes ainsi qu'une puissance de feu dévastatrice. Les membres humains de l'équipe de recherches ont été expulsés par les Haak, et ils ont redirigé le laser de croisière sur trois de nos grandes villes.  Commandant, il faut détruire chacun de ces trois lasers avant que les Haak ne s'en servent. Ce serait la mort pour des milliers de personnes.

# Hydro
HYD_LOCATION			LA GÉNÉRATRICE  HYDROÉLÉCTRIQUE SOUTERRAINE
HYD_TIME			20:08
HYD_OBJECTIVE			Trouver le prototype  du sous-marin pour le détruire
HYD_BRIEFING			L'armée Haak a sous-estimé la puissance de notre marine et nous avons pris le dessus sur l'ennemi dans cette région depuis quelques semaines. Tout pourrait changer si nous n'agissons pas immédiatement. Nos espions nous disent que l'armée Haak a pris le contrôle d'un barrage sous-terrain. Ils ont utilisé une énorme quantité d'électricité pour recharger une sorte de super-arme amphibie.  Nous avons trouvé un déversoir d'urgence pour le barrage. Votre mission est de vous infiltrer dans cette base sous-terraine et de détruire ce barrage avant que cette super-arme ne soit opérationnelle.

# City
CIT_LOCATION			CITÉ DE RECHERCHES RED DOG
CIT_TIME			05:08
CIT_OBJECTIVE			Détruire les soldats Haak pour protéger la base de recherche
CIT_BRIEFING			L'armée Haak a lancé une attaque de grande envergure contre notre plus grande base de recherche militaire. Heureusement la plupart des habitants a pu être évacuée avant le début de l'attaque. Par contre, un petit groupe est resté pour terminer leurs recherches avant que tout soit détruit. A présent il faut les sortir de là.  Votre mission est d'atteindre le laboratoire principal où se trouvent les scientifiques. Détruisez les unités Haak autour, pour sauver les scientifiques.

CIT_LOCATION2			CITÉ DE RECHERCHES RED DOG
CIT_TIME2			05:11
CIT_OBJECTIVE2			ESCORTER LES SCIENTIFIQUES AU BUNKER
CIT_BRIEFING2			Escorter le véhicule blindé à l'abri en suivant les fusées éclairantes vertes. Il faudra éliminer les extra-terrestres qui vous barrent la route.

CIT_LOCATION3			CITÉ DE RECHERCHES RED DOG
CIT_TIME3			05:15
CIT_OBJECTIVE3			PROTÉGER LE BUNKER JUSQU'À L'ARRIVÉE DU TRANSPORTEUR
CIT_BRIEFING3			Le transporteur arrivera dans à peu près deux minutes. Il faut protéger le bunker à tout prix en attendant l'arrivée du transporteur. Les Ha'ak se rendent compte de l'importance de nos scientifiques, et ils ont mobilisé plusieurs unités pour essayer de détruire ce bunker. Le blindage qui protège ces unités est presque impénétrable, et vos armes n'auront presque pas d'effet. Il faut cibler le seul petit point faible qui se trouve à l'arrière du véhicule... si vous le touchez, la réaction en chaîne produite, détruira l'unité.

# Alien
ALI_LOCATION			LE RAVITAILLEUR HAAK, EN ORBITE AUTOUR DE LA TERRE
ALI_TIME				01:00
ALI_OBJECTIVE			Détruire le réacteur central
ALI_BRIEFING			L'armée Haak, affaiblie par les batailles importantes que nous avons gagnées sur Terre, se regroupe sur le ravitailleur pour une dernière poussée. Malheureusement nos victoires ont coûté cher à l'armée Red Dog. S'ils attaquaient en masse tout de suite, nous n'aurons aucune chance. Pour cette raison, il est essentiel de les surprendre avant qu'ils nous attaquent... Nous les attaquerons avec tout ce qu'on a, pour créer une diversion qui en principe nous permettra de vous larguer sur l'extérieur du ravitailleur. De là vous devez trouver le réacteur central et tout faire sauter.  C'est la dernière chance pour la Terre. Bonne chance.

# Volcano
VOL_LOCATION			KRAKATAU, SUNDA-MEERENGE
VOL_TIME				13:51 Uhr
VOL_OBJECTIVE			GENERATOR AUSFINDIG MACHEN UND ZERSTÖREN
VOL_BRIEFING			Die Truppen der Haak beginnen damit, einen Stützpunkt auf dieser vulkanischen Insel zu errichten. Durch unseren Geheimdienst haben wir die Information erhalten, dass der mobile Generator, der den Stützpunkt mit Strom versorgt, in den Tiefen des Vulkans installiert wurde: Bald kann der Stützpunkt in Betrieb genommen werden. Wenn wir zulassen, dass diese Basis voll einsatzfähig wird, werden die Haak ihre Gelegenheit zu einem vernichtenden strategischen Vorstoß auf die alliierten Streitkräfte haben. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, zu dem mobilen Generator zu gelangen und ihn zu zerstören.

# Canyon
CAN_LOCATION			GRAND CANYON-HANDELSAUßENPOSTEN
CAN_TIME			11:35 Uhr
CAN_OBJECTIVE			ESKORTE FÜR DROID MIT CHEMISCHEN WAFFEN
CAN_BRIEFING			Wir müssen diesen abgelegenen Umschlagplatz, der den Haak als erster in die Hände fiel, wieder zurückerobern. In der Nähe des Handelsortes hat unser Militär einen Sprengkörper mit chemischen Giften errichtet. Sie müssen diese Ladung bis ans Ende der Docks zur Alien-Zentrale bringen. Die Hülle des Transporters ist leicht zerstörbar; sorgen Sie also dafür, dass nichts zwischen den Tanker und das Ziel kommt.
CAN_SCRIPT1				Machen Sie sich aus dem Staub, Kommandant. Der Droid ist aktiviert und wird gleich explodieren. Gehen Sie zurück nach draußen, Sie werden dann aus dem Explosionsbereich abgeholt.
CAN_SCRIPT2				ACHTUNG !!! Haak-Kriegsschiff nähert sich uns rasch von hinten!!

# Ice
ICE_LOCATION			ANTARKTIS
ICE_TIME			08:20 Uhr
ICE_OBJECTIVE			BEDROHUNG DURCH 'CRUISE LASER' ABWEHREN
ICE_BRIEFING			Im antarktischen Forschungszentrum haben wir in Zusammenarbeit mit den Haak einen Angriffslaser entwickelt. Dieser 'Cruise Laser' hat eine unübertroffene Reichweite und vernichtende Zerstörungskraft. Alle menschlichen Mitglieder des Forschungsteams wurden jedoch aus dem Forschungszentrum verbannt, und die Haak richten den 'Cruise Laser' jetzt auf drei unserer strategischen Orte.  Sie müssen dort rein und alle 'Cruise Laser' zerstören, ehe die Haak sich entschließen, sie zu aktivieren, und Tausende ums Leben kommen.

# Hydro
HYD_LOCATION			UNTERIRDISCHER DAMM
HYD_TIME			20:08 Uhr
HYD_OBJECTIVE			U-BOOTPROTOTYP SUCHEN UND ZERSTÖREN
HYD_BRIEFING			Die Haak haben die Macht unserer Seestreitkräfte schwer unterschätzt, und in den letzten Wochen konnten wir beachtliche Vorstöße auf diesem Gebiet verzeichnen. Aber um diesen Vorteil auszubauen, müssen wir rasch handeln. Unser Geheimdienst informiert uns, dass die Haak einen unterirdischen Dammkomplex übernommen haben. Mit diesem gewinnen sie große Mengen an Energie, um den Prototyp einer amphibischen Superwaffe aufzuladen.  Wir haben ein als Zugang fungierendes Notabflussrohr entdeckt, durch das Sie den Damm erreichen können. Sie haben die Aufgabe, diese unterirdische Basis zu infiltrieren und den Damm zu zerstören, bevor die Superwaffe funktionsbereit wird.

# City
CIT_LOCATION			DIE RED DOG-FORSCHUNGSANSTALT
CIT_TIME			05:08 Uhr
CIT_OBJECTIVE			ZERSTÖRUNG DER ANGREIFENDEN HAAK-TRUPPEN
CIT_BRIEFING			Die Truppen der Haak haben eine großangelegte Offensive auf unser wichtigstes Waffenforschungszentrum gestartet. Glücklicherweise konnte der größte Teil der Belegschaft rechtzeitig vor dem Angriff evakuiert werden. Einige blieben jedoch zurück, um die Forschungsergebnisse vor der totalen Vernichtung zu bewahren. Diese Personen müssen jetzt geborgen werden.  Damit sich die verbliebenen Wissenschaftler in Sicherheit bringen können, müssen Sie zu dem zentralen Forschungsgebäude vorstoßen, und die Haak-Einheiten zerstören.

CIT_LOCATION2			DIE RED DOG-FORSCHUNGSANSTALT
CIT_TIME2			05:11 Uhr
CIT_OBJECTIVE2			WISSENSCHAFTLER ZU SICHERER ZONE ZU GELEITEN
CIT_BRIEFING2			Den Panzerwagen entlang eines Pfades, der mit grünen Leuchtfeuern gekennzeichnet ist, zu dem sicheren Bunker geleiten. Unterwegs jeden feindlichen Widerstand aus dem Weg räumen.

CIT_LOCATION3			DIE RED DOG-FORSCHUNGSANSTALT
CIT_TIME3			05:15 Uhr
CIT_OBJECTIVE3			BUNKER BIS ZUR ANKUNFT VON TRANSPORT-KAPSEL SCHÜTZEN
CIT_BRIEFING3			Die Transportkapsel wird in vermutlich zwei Minuten eintreffen. Sie müssen den Bunker um jeden Preis verteidigen, bis die Transportkapsel eintrifft. Die Ha'ak wissen um die Bedeutung unserer Wissenschaftler und haben eine Reihe von Spezialeinheiten mobilisiert, um den Bunker zu zerstören. Diese Einheiten verfügen über schwere Panzerfahrzeuge und sind gegenüber unseren Schusswaffen fast immun. Sie haben nur eine Schwachstelle: ein kleiner Bereich am Hinterteil des Fahrzeugs, der, falls getroffen, eine Kettenreaktion auslöst, die die gesamte Einheit vernichtet.

# Alien
ALI_LOCATION			HAAK-MUTTERSCHIFF, IN DER ERDUMLAUFBAHN
ALI_TIME				01:00 Uhr
ALI_OBJECTIVE			KERN DES ZENTRALGENERATORS ZERSTÖREN
ALI_BRIEFING			Nachdem wir die Macht der Haak auf der Erde durch unsere Erfolge beträchtlich geschwächt haben, versammeln sie sich auf ihrem Mutterschiff, um einen letzten Angriff vorzubereiten. Leider wurden unsere Streitkräfte bei den erfolgreichen Einsätzen schwer dezimiert und würden im Falle eines Massenangriffs keine Aussicht auf Erfolg haben. Wir müssen ihnen daher zuvorkommen ... Zur Ablenkung werden wir sie mit allen verfügbaren Mitteln angreifen. Diese Gelegenheit werden wir dazu nutzen, Sie auf außerhalb des Mutterschiffs abzusetzen. Von dort aus müssen Sie zum Kern des Hauptreaktors, um ihn in die Luft zu jagen.  Dies ist unsere letzte Chance. Viel Glück.

# Volcano
VOL_LOCATION			KRAKATAU, SUNDA STRAIT
VOL_TIME				13.51
VOL_OBJECTIVE			ENCONTRAR Y DESTRUIR EL GENERADOR
VOL_BRIEFING			El ejército Haak está construyendo una base en una isla volcánica. Nuestro servicio de inteligencia nos ha comunicado que el generador portátil Haak, que suministra la energía a la base, se encuentra situado en el corazón del volcán, y no falta mucho tiempo para que la base esté en pleno funcionamiento. Si lo permitimos, conseguirán dominar un importante punto estratégico con el subsecuente daño a las fuerzas aliadas. Tu misión es llegar hasta el generador y destruirlo.

# Canyon
CAN_LOCATION			Gran Cañón
CAN_TIME			11.35
CAN_OBJECTIVE			Escoltar el Vehículo de Transporte
CAN_BRIEFING			Este remoto enclave comercial fue el primero en caer en manos del ejército Haak. Ya ha llegado la hora de recuperarlo. Hemos colocado un artefacto explosivo en un enclave militar cercano. Necesitamos que protejas el cargamento de la comunidad de extraterrestres hasta llegar al otro extremo del puerto. El vehículo de transporte es muy frágil, así que no permitas que nada se interponga en su camino.
CAN_SCRIPT1				Comandante, será mejor que salgas de ahí. El explosivo ha sido activado y está a punto de estallar. Vuelve hacia atrás para que podamos recogerte.
CAN_SCRIPT2				¡¡CUIDADO!! ¡¡Una nave de guerra te va pisando los talones!!

# Ice
ICE_LOCATION			La Región Antártica
ICE_TIME			08.20
ICE_OBJECTIVE			Eliminar la Amenaza del Láser Teledirigido 
ICE_BRIEFING			En nuestro centro de investigación de la Antártica hemos desarrollado un láser de ataque junto con el ejército Haak. El Láser Teledirigido tiene un alcance y un poder de destrucción jamás vistos. Sin embargo, todos los humanos del grupo de científicos han sido expulsados del centro y los Haak están apuntando con el láser tres de nuestras ciudades principales.  Comandante, diríjase allí y destruya cada uno de los láseres teledirigidos antes de que los Haak decidan utilizarlos y aniquilen a millares de personas.

# Hydro
HYD_LOCATION			GENERADOR HIDROELÉCTRICO SUBTERRÁNEO
HYD_TIME			20.08
HYD_OBJECTIVE			INFILTRARSE Y DESTRUIR EL SUBMARINO EXPERIMENTAL
HYD_BRIEFING			Haak ha subestimado el poder de nuestra armada, que ha conseguido importantes victorias durante las últimas semanas. Todo esto puede cambiar si no actuamos con rapidez. Nuestro servicio de inteligencia nos ha informado de que las fuerzas Haak han tomado el mando de una presa subterránea y están extrayendo enormes cantidades de energía para recargar un prototipo de arma anfibia.  Hemos encontrado una entrada de emergencia a la presa. Tu misión es infiltrarte en esta base subterránea y destruir la presa antes de que pongan en funcionamiento la nueva arma.

# City
CIT_LOCATION			CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN RED DOG
CIT_TIME			05.08
CIT_OBJECTIVE			DESTRUIR LAS FUERZAS HAAK
CIT_BRIEFING			Las fuerzas de Haak han lanzado una ofensiva a gran escala contra nuestro centro principal de investigación militar. Por suerte, la mayoría de la población ha sido evacuada antes del ataque. Sin embargo, un grupo escogido de científicos se ha quedado atrás para recopilar los resultados de las investigaciones antes de se pierdan para siempre. Ha llegado la hora de rescatarlos.  Tu misión es llegar hasta el centro de investigación donde se encuentran los científicos y destruir la fuerzas Haak de la inmediaciones, para que puedan escapar los científicos.

CIT_LOCATION3			CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN RED DOG
CIT_TIME3			05.15
CIT_OBJECTIVE3			PROTEGE EL BUNKER HASTA QUE LLEGUE LA UNIDAD DE TRANSPORTE
CIT_BRIEFING3			La unidad de transporte aéreo llegará en aproximadamente dos minutos. Tienes que proteger el bunker a toda costa hasta que llegue. Las fuerzas Ha'ak saben lo importante que son esos científicos para nosotros, y han movilizado un gran número de vehículos de combate para acabar con ellos. Esos vehículos están fuertemente blindados y son prácticamente invulnerables. Sólo tienen un punto débil, una zona pequeña en la parte de atrás del vehículo. Si la alcanzas, se producirá una reacción en cadena que destruirá el vehículo.

# Alien
ALI_LOCATION			NAVE NODRIZA HAAK, ORBITANDO ALREDEDOR DE LA TIERRA

ALI_OBJECTIVE			DESTRUIR EL GENERADOR DE ENERGÍA
ALI_BRIEFING			Debilitado por nuestras continuas victorias en la Tierra, el ejército Haak se está reagrupando en su nave nodriza para preparar una ofensiva final. Por desgracia, nuestros operativos Red Dog han sufrido graves pérdidas durante la lucha. Si nos atacan en masa, no podremos detenerles. Por eso, debemos ser nosotros los primeros en atacar.  Vamos a hacer todo lo que podamos para distraer al enemigo y dejarte en la superficie de la nave nodriza. Desde ahí, tienes que llegar al reactor central y destruir la nave desde dentro.  Ésta es la última esperanza del planeta Tierra. Buena suerte.
